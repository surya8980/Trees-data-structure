# [Inorder Traversal Of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

## Example:

Input: root = [1,null,2,3]

Output: [1,3,2]

## Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
